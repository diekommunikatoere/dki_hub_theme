# DKI Hub Theme Release Build Script (Worktree-based, dev parity)
# 1. Creates a temporary git worktree for release branch
# 2. Copies main branch contents into worktree
# 3. Builds blocks in-place in worktree
# 4. Compiles SCSS to CSS
# 5. Removes files/dirs listed in .releaseignore
# 6. Global cleanup: removes dev/source files and empty dirs
# 7. Commits and pushes to release branch
